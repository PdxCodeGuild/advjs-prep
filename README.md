# Advanced JS, Node, React Class Prep

Although this class is largely about Node and React, it is first and foremost about Javascript itself. That means the more Javascript fundamentals you have down when entering the course, the more likely it will be that you will hit the ground running. With that in mind, here is some pre-course material to work through before we start the course.

## Readings from Elequent JavaScript
- [Higher Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html)
- [Modules](https://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html)
- [Asynchronous Programming](https://eloquentjavascript.net/11_async.html)
- [The Document Object Model (DOM)](https://eloquentjavascript.net/14_dom.html)

## Lab
This workshop, [map and friends](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/map-and-friends), will guide you towards understanding how to use the map, filter, and reduce array methods, as well as lambda functions (which we will be using A LOT in the course).

## Extra Resources
This section is not required but it would be good practice. Consider skimming it over and focusing on the parts you need more practice with. This might be especially important if you find Eloquent Javascript too difficult.

### MDN

MDN also has some good resources for learning javascript.

* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [JavaScript First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps)
  * if Eloquent Javascript is way over your head, this would be a good place to start!

### Free Code Camp

Some people have found Free Code Camp helpful.

There are also two sections of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) curriculumn that seem good for preparing for the Advanced JS, Node, React class.

### JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- Basic JavaScript
- ES6
- Debugging
- Basic Algorithm Scripting
- Functional Programming
- Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

The below section is especially not required, but would be good practice for those of you that want to get ahead!

### APIs and Microservices
- Managing Packacges with Npm
- Basic Node and Express
- MongoDB
