# Advanced JS, Node, React Class Prep

Since this is the advanced javascript course, I am hoping everyone entering this course has the basics of javascript down. However, I can't make too many assumptions about what students know, in large part because the core course is taught differently by every instructor and every cohort of students moves at a different pace (meaning some classes don't cover things like the asynchronous programming model of javascript, as an example). So, I have decided to take the first week as a chance to do a javascript crash course. I want this javascript crash course week to go smoothly, so please review the following material if you think you need to catch up (or if you just want to get ahead).

## Readings from Elequent JavaScript
- [Higher Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html)
- [Modules](https://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html)
- [Asynchronous Programming](https://eloquentjavascript.net/11_async.html)
- [The Document Object Model (DOM)](https://eloquentjavascript.net/14_dom.html)

## Practical Application from freeCodeCamp

There are two sections of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) curriculumn that will help you prep for the Advanced JS, Node, React class.

### JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- Basic JavaScript
- ES6
- Debugging
- Basic Algorithm Scripting
- Functional Programming
- Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

## Extra
This section is not required but it would be good practice to familarize yourself before the Node section.

### APIs and Microservices
- Managing Packacges with Npm
- Basic Node and Express
- MongoDB
